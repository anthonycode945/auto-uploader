# auto-uploader
Auto uploads YouTube shorts to TikTok!
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What this .py script does is, it connects to your TikTok account, then in the config, you set the YouTube channel to track, then whenever they post, the python script will grab the video, and upload it to TikTok!

This is meant for things like uploading your YouTube videos to TikTok automatically.

This is not ready yet, if you see no release or .py file, that means the project is still a WIP.
